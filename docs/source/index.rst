Welcome to the COVERAGE-PLAN documentation!
===========================================

Welcome to the documentation for COVERAGE-PLAN, a lifelong coverage planner for dynamic and uncertain environments.
The final release will operate entirely within ROS.
The current release operates on abstract grid environments in discrete time.

Installation instructions can be found :doc:`here <../installation>`.
The :doc:`tutorials <../tutorials>` page contains an in-depth tutorial describing how to run our coverage planner in an environment with known dynamics.
This covers the core usage of COVERAGE-PLAN, and contains a description on how this code can be adapted for unknown environments (using a one line change).
